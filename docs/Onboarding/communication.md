# Communication

## Chat
The Apicurio team has multiple communication channels we use for various communications.

## Core Internal communications
The Apicurio team uses GChat to communicate internally within the team.  The following GChat spaces are important:

[apicurio-team](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#chat/space/AAAAnK5QyQ0)- chat amongst the Apicurio team only.  A very small and exclusive space!

[apicurio-dev](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#chat/space/AAAAyw20bSc)- space used to discuss development/technical issues about Apicurio projects.  Membership includes any Red Hatter interested in contributing to Apicurio projects.

[apicurio](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#chat/space/AAAA79P-pXw) - space used to discuss any topic related to Apicurio projects or collaborations.  This has a wide membership and is low traffic.

[service-registry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaCf3p7dMpbCqATIBsuPkEbNDRTnVi-kv_bXeYvlsZ0/edit#:~:text=https%3A//mail.google.-,com,-/mail/u/1)- used to discuss the productized version of Apicurio Registry, called “Service Registry” in many contexts.

## Upstream communications
To better support the open source (upstream) community, we use Zulip Chat.  This allows community members (non Red Hatters) to chat about Apicurio issues directly with the team.

## Operations communications
When collaborating with the various Operations teams that help us run our software, we use Slack (because it is the preferred channel for those teams). 

Some important Slack channels are:

[3scale-ops-mas](https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C0586GTTXH9)- channel used to collaborate with the 3scale operations team that provide development/staging OpenShift clusters for us to use for testing.

[rhtap-users](https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/C04PZ7H0VA8) - channel used to ask for help with the RHTAP build system.

## Mailing Lists
Google groups are used for managing mailing lists.

[apicurio-registry](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/redhat.com/g/apicurio-registry) mailing list is an important one.

[service-registry](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/redhat.com/g/service-registry) is the same but for the product version of registry.

[service-registry-dev](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/redhat.com/g/service-registry-dev) is a list just for the dev team.

[service-registry-eng-help](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/redhat.com/g/service-registry-eng-help) is sometimes used by the field to get help for 
Service Registry issues at customer sites.
