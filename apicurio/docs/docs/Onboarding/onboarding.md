# Apicurio Onboarding

_Red Hat API Registry & Designer_

Welcome to our team! We're thrilled to have you join us on this exciting journey. This guide provides team-specific information to help you get off to a great and productive start.

The Apicurio team is responsible for several upstream projects that have varying degrees of product impact.  We primarily focus our efforts in the API and Schema spaces.  Two main areas we develop in are:
API/Schema Design - software to help users design new or existing APIs and Schemas.
API/Schema Registry - software that allows users to register their APIs and Schemas in a centralized registry.
