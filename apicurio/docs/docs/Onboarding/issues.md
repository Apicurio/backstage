# Using JIRA or Github Issues

We use a mix of JIRA and GitHub issues to track bugs and features.  JIRA is primarily used to track work requested by customers, and for bureaucratic/product related tasks.  As a result, most of our task tracking is done in GitHub, using GitHub issues in the appropriate repositories.  Therefore, tracking of work on Apicurio Registry is typically done in the apicurio-registry git repository.

However, we do also have two GitHub repositories that we use to track tasks that donâ€™t correspond to a specific upstream project.  This includes Epics (high level tracking of major or broadly scoped efforts) and downstream tasks.  These repositories are:

* [Epics](https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-epics/issues)
* [Downstream Tasks](https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-tasks/issues)

We also maintain several upstream Project boards that can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/Apicurio/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
