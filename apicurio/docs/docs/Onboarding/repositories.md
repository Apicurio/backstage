# Repositories

The Apicurio team is responsible for a number of projects, and thus we have several repositories that we work on.  A good starting point is the [Apicurio organization in GitHub](https://github.com/Apicurio/).

For a full list of git repositories, check out this [curated list in Google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18CW8-HofJqShCaiwltyUF9OWuTgHyLleplg2bOkZ_XQ/edit#gid=0).
